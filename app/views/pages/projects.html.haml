      %p.details This is a web app that I developed software for as a part of the Fresh Start Software team. I wrote both front end and back end code that enabled employees of this nonprofit organization to edit the pages as needed. Also implemented functionality to add new fields to existing models.

      %p.details On this solo project, I volunteered for this nonprofit organization by developing software. They sought someone to add functionality to their employee side web application. Some of the features included a method that calculates holidays throughout the year including Labor Day and Thanksgiving and adjusting schedules accordingly as well as adding new tracking records to those who recieved services.
